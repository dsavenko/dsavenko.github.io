This is a short novel, which I wrote 5 years ago for a literature contest called [Рваная грелка](http://grelka.teamslc.net/17/) ("Lacerated hot water bottle"). By the contest rules, all participants are given 48 hours to write a short story on a given topic (that time, the topic was *"В надежде славы и добра",* which roughly translates as "In hopes of fame and bliss to come"). After that, the participants read each other's stories and vote for them in two-round poll. 

A friend of mine recently reminded me of the events of that days. My story didn't pass to the second round, so it's probably not that good :) Anyway, I like it, and the friend liked it as well. I also got some positive responses back then. So, **[there it is](http://grelka.teamslc.net/17/view.html?id=256)**! Read at your own risk :)

P.S. It's in Russian. I can't translate it to English properly.
