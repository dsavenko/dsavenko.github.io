**[Xored Quiz][quiz]** is an assessment test for software engineers. It consists of questions covering algorithms, data structures, OOP concepts and some other fundamental (but language-agnostic) topics.

I created the questions and led the development of the website (including the internal admin page). Actual programming and design were done by other people.
